# Fetal-Health-Status-Prediction-Using-multiple-Machine-Learning-algorithms-using-Python
Machine learning models developed to predict the fetal health status during the pregnancy cycle. Our models are trained on Cardiotocograms (CTGs) data collected from 2126 experiments. Models used are Support Vector Classifier, K-nearest neighbors, XG boost and a stacking classifier. All the model are trained on the training data and tested using test dataset. Hyper-parameter tuning is applied on all the models to select the best. After careful comparison of models, Support Vector classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 99%. The complete development is in python.
